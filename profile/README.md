## What is TeraCopy Pro?

**TeraCopy Pro** is an advanced file copy utility designed to move your files as fast and securely as possible. It is engineered to maximize transfer speeds, minimize CPU usage, and provide a robust solution for handling large files and extensive file operations. Unlike standard Windows file copying, TeraCopy Pro dynamically adjusts buffers to accelerate data transfer, checks files for errors post-copy, and allows you to pause and resume file transfers at any time.

Ideal for professionals, IT administrators, and power users, TeraCopy Pro integrates seamlessly into Windows Explorer, replacing the standard copy and move functions. It provides detailed error reports and offers various methods to resolve file conflicts, ensuring your data is managed efficiently and correctly. Whether you are backing up critical data, migrating large volumes of files, or simply managing your daily file operations, TeraCopy Pro offers a reliable and significantly improved experience over built-in system tools.
